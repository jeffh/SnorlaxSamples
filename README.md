Snorlax Samples
===============

Example projects that integrate with [Snorlax](https://github.com/jeffh/Snorlax).

This demonstrates how to integrate using
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage),
[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), and
[SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

There are two different versions being integrated:

- **v0.1.0** of Snorlax does not bring any dependencies of its own
- **v0.2.0** of Snorlax brings in PromiseKit as an additional dependency for Apple's platforms (not SPM)
